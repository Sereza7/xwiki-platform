/* CKEditor contains a CSS reset. It works with its own style sheets and does not use the ones in XWiki.
  However, we want `.sr-only` from XWiki to still be usable in our CKEditor plugins.
  We need to redefine this class to have better priority than the CKEditor CSS reset.
  Without this, the elements with this class are still shown
  which would be different from the behaviour of `.sr-only` anywhere else in XWiki (as described in our doc). 
  This redefinition allows for a more consistent behaviour of the `.sr-only` class. */
