/* We hide images in the autocomplete dropdowns that do not have any source.
  This is especially important for assistive tech users (regular users cannot see the image if there's no source).
  Note that this extra style is required because the itemTemplate feature of CKEditor autocomplete 
  is not powerful enough to support our specific usecase. */
